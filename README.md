## Overview
Geniphy_ai is a generative AI model developed to produce high-quality image outputs with detailed control over style, resolution, and other properties. Built to run on the L4 GPU in Google Colab, the project leverages GPU-accelerated processing, making it suitable for real-time applications and fast experimentation.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements
To run Geniphy_ai, make sure the following libraries are installed:
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab Pro (recommended for access to the L4 GPU)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local or Colab environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Geniphy_ai.git
   cd Geniphy_ai
   ```

2. Run the notebook file `Geniphy_ai_v1.0.ipynb` in Google Colab.

3. Select the **NVIDIA L4 GPU** as the hardware accelerator in Colab (Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU).

## Features
- **High-quality output generation**: The model can produce lifelike images with customizable parameters.
- **Real-time processing**: Utilizing Google Colabâ€™s L4 GPU ensures fast, efficient output.
- **Configurable parameters**: Adjust styles, details, and generation parameters to suit various project needs.
- **Integrated visualization**: See output images in real-time within the Colab notebook.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Can run on other platforms with compatible GPU resources.

## Usage
1. **Load the Notebook**: Open `Geniphy_ai_v1.0.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust the input parameters in the designated cells of the notebook.
3. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in order to generate outputs.
4. **Save and Export**: Output images can be saved directly from Colab.
